1. There are two ways to clone the repository:
Option 1: Clone the repository from FlowerWorker/hello
git clone <repo-url>

Option 2: Fork the repository to make a copy of your own, and select "Copy the main branch only" (Recommended)
Clone your forked repository
git clone <your-repo-url>


2. Check your current remotes:
git remote -v

You should see something like this:

Continue from option 1:
origin  https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git (push)

then, add the remote upstream
git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/FlowerWorker/hello.git

Continue from option 2:
origin    https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git (push)


3. Fetch update from upstream (Only for option 2)
This fetches the branches and their commits from the upstream repository.
git fetch upstream

or you can use github desktop to fetch upstream.


4. Checkout to the branch we are working on right now. (It is "develop", not "main" by default)
git checkout develop

or you can find the checkout button on VS code.


5. Create and Checkout a new branch from develop.
git checkout -b <branch-name>
(replace <branch-name> with the name you want)

or you can use the checkout button on VS code and select "Create a new branch from ..."


6. Merge or Rebase updates
After fetching, you can update your local branches with the upstream changes.

Merge upstream changes into your branch:
git checkout <branch-name>
git merge upstream/develop

Rebase with upstream changes:
Alternatively, you can rebase your branch with the upstram branch:
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase upstream/develop


7. Push changes to your fork 
After merging or rebasing, push the updated branch to your fork.
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin <branch-name>

or do it in the source control in VS code
or with the github desktop.


8. Create a Pull Request (PR)
Once your branch is pushed, you can create a PR to merge your branch into the target branch (develop).
